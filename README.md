# snake-game-project
This is a java game where the objective is to control a snake on a game board and guide it to eat food while avoiding obstacles and its own tail. As the snake eats the food, it grows in length, making it more difficult to navigate.

The game board consists of a grid of squares, and the snake is initially positioned on one of the squares. The snake moves in a specific direction (usually up, down, left, or right) with each key press, and the player must guide the snake to eat the food without running into any obstacles or the snake's own tail. If the snake hits an obstacle or its own tail, the game is over.
